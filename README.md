# 😊 Mood Tracker Flask App

A simple Flask web application that lets users submit how they feel and keeps a history of mood entries. Entries show friendly timestamps like "just now" or "2 days ago." The app uses server-side validation and flash messages for feedback.

- Open `http://localhost:5555` in your browser.
- Enter your name and select your current mood from the dropdown.
